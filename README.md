usePopcorn is an application built with React that allows users to search for movies and create a personal list of watched movies with their own ratings that they can manage and update. By using the OMDB API (Open Movie Database), this application is open to a extensive movie database, allowing users to search for practically any movie and see different datapoints about that movie such as plot, movie poster, runtime, and imdb rating. This application is a part of a React course offered by Jonas Schmedtmann via the Udemy platform. I built the application when I took the course then continued to improve it by making it fully responsive, improving the organizational structure, improving the useMovies custom hook, and implementing CSS modules.
